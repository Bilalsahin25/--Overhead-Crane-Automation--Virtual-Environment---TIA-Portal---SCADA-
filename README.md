 Overhead Crane Automation (Virtual Environment - TIA Portal & SCADA)
Project Description:
This project focuses on developing an automation system for an overhead crane using TIA Portal and SCADA in a virtual environment. The system is entirely designed and tested in a simulation environment without the need for physical hardware. It includes motion control and load handling processes modeled through software-based solutions.

Project Title: Overhead Crane Automation (Virtual Environment - TIA Portal & SCADA)
Project Description:
This project focuses on developing an automation system for an overhead crane using TIA Portal and SCADA in a virtual environment. The system is entirely designed and tested in a simulation environment without the need for physical hardware. It includes motion control and load handling processes modeled through software-based solutions.

Technologies Used:
TIA Portal: For Siemens PLC programming and simulation.
SCADA: For creating operator interfaces and monitoring system performance.
PLC Simulation: To execute and test the project entirely in a virtual environment.
Features:
Fully Virtual Development: The project is developed and tested exclusively in the TIA Portal and SCADA simulation environment.
Motion Control: Ensures safe and optimized movement of the crane across X, Y, and Z axes.
SCADA Visualization: Enables operators to monitor crane status and movements in real-time.
Ease of Testing: Allows quick testing of various scenarios in the simulation environment.
